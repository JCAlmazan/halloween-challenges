😴 Challenge 2: Freddy Krueger - "Count the Sheep"
📖 Story
It's midnight on Elm Street and you desperately need to sleep. You try to count sheep, but the letters in your mind are completely scrambled by Freddy.

You have a chaotic string of text with mixed letters. Your only escape is to count how many times you can form the word "sheep" before Freddy catches you in the nightmare.

Your mission: Count how many complete sheep you can form with the available letters.

💻 The Challenge
Create a function countSheep(letters) that:

Receives a string with scrambled letters
Counts how many times you can form the word "sheep"
Returns the number of complete sheep you can count
Important: To form "sheep" you need: s, h, e, e, p (the 'e' appears 2 times)

📝 Examples
```typescript
countSheep('sheepxsheepy')
// → 2 (you can form "sheep" twice)

countSheep('sshhheeeepppp')
// → 2 (s=2, h=3, e=4, p=4 → only 2 complete "sheep")

countSheep('hola')
// → 0 (not enough letters)

countSheep('peesh')
// → 1 (letters are scrambled but they're all there)
```
